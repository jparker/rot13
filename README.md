# Rot13

This is an over-engineered implementation of ROT13 encoding. It provides a very
simple example of an Elixir application with regular tests, doctests, type
specifications, and an escript.

(I make no promises that these are examples of best practices of any of these
features, but it gave me a chance to practice.)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `rot13` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:rot13, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/rot13](https://hexdocs.pm/rot13).
